This program is a simulator for the game of life (on a MxN matrix).\
There are two types of individuals: '+' and '0'. Individuals of the same type can not attack each-other, but individuals of different types do.\
Every individual goes through a process of feeding, multiplication, attacking and aging.\
Their current life state (alive/dead) is represented by a '1' or a '0' on the matrix.
