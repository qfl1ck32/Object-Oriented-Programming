# Description

This project represents a game in which two "tanks" walk through a map and attack each-other.

# How to play

After running the game, you will need to enter some details about two  tanks, such as:
  * Name (should be one letter long)
  * Left / Right / Up / Down / Fire keys
  * Coordinates (for the pre-made map, they should be both even)
