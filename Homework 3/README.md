## This project represents a simulation for a bank application, in which you can manage the accounts.

Every account has an owner (with his own personal details), a balance, the date at which it was created, a correctly generated IBAN
and other details, depending on the type of the bank account.

Currently, the supported actions are as follows:

 #####  1. Create an account
 
 ##### 2. Delete an account
 
 ##### 3. Show an account based on:
   - ##### IBAN
   - ##### Personal Numeric Code
   - ##### ID (which represents the n-th account opened in the bank)
 
 ##### 4. Show all the opened accounts.
